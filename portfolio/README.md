This code allows you to perform risky assets analysis through the calculation of several values. Firstly, it reads data pertaining to several risky assets (in this case 5).

Part 1:
Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, return-risk ratio. Results are plotted on a return-risk graph

Part 2:
Data visualization - plots the distribution for each asset class

Part 3:
Calculates the covariance and correlation matrix. The coveriance matrix is verified to be non-singular, symmetric, and positive definite

Part 4:
Weights, returns and risks were calculated for a minimum variance portfolio with expected return of 9%. The efficient frontier is also found, and results were plotted

Part 5:
Exponentially weighted moving average coveriance matrix was found
